# Getting started

## Preparation

- **Obtain an** [OpenAI API Secret Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Set some sane limits/thresholds for alerts**
   
   _I personally spent $5 (the minimum to get started I think) and capped it to maybe $2 - this doesn't use a lot of tokens_
- Copy your key into a `.env` at the root of the project like
   ```text
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
   ```
## Have fun!
